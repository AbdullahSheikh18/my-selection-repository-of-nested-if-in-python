This repository showcases the implementation of **nested if statements** to make selections between two broad categories: **Sports** and **Arts**. Within these categories, the user can further choose specific topics:

- **Sports**: Football, Cricket
- **Arts**: Music

The project uses **nested if statements** to navigate through the user's choices and display the corresponding output based on their selections. It is a simple, interactive way to understand how nested conditional logic can be used in decision-making scenarios. The example demonstrates how branching works by allowing the user to choose a category and then a subcategory, with proper handling of invalid inputs.

This project is useful for learning and practicing the basics of conditional statements in programming.
